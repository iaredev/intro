# Problem statement

At the present  time, Seashores are major tourist attractions.  But cleanliness in our seashore are very low.Suggest a mechanism to ensure pollution free seashores.

# Abstract

we are working on the problem statement about cleanliness of seashores
so we have created a website where we are working with the municipal corporation to help them clean our beaches effectively and efficiently.

primarily , we are focused on encouraging people to help us clean the beaches . 
to achieve this , we have created our own cryptocurrency Kuns which will has multiple use cases in our hack.
we plan to organise events and competitions regularly where common people will come and join our hands in cleaning the beach.
beach cleaning days will be organised where volunteers can come and help us and top volunteers will be gifted some amount of our tokens

the reason why we created our own token is that , inititally we dont have funds to give away but by giving our token we are making people a part of our
community whose growth will lead to the growth of out token too.

Additionally , Some people will be hired to impose heavy fines if we find someone guilty of polluting our beach.
The fine would be 250/-approx.
people paying fine will get a discount if they choose to pay with our token

secondarily,if the beach get polluted which is obvious.so we have build 2 ML models

1.Time series analysis for predicting amount of waste that would be generated using the previous data.
this will help in knowing which day in a week the waste generated would be maximum and accordingly we can send our workers to clean it.
second use of time series analysis is to predict when the crowd on the beach would be minimum at a particular time in a beach so we can send 
workers at that particular time to clean the beach efficiently.

2nd mL model we have use is image classifer,it helps in segregation of waste,because of which all the organic waste and recyclable waste that 
is collected can be suplied to companies and we will ask them to buy it using our cryptocurrency so that our token value will also be increased.
all the hazardous waste would be given to municipal.
so basically our main source of income would be revenue collected from industry and imposing fine on people polluting the beach.

according to The Hindu,on an average on a urban beach 71% is plastic 28%non plastic and 1% biomedical

we also tried to implement object density model where it could be helpful to indicate the density of waste at a any particular case but we removed it for now due
to overhead cost,but we definetly come up with a solution for this.

# assumptions

we expect municipal corporations to co-operate with us as we don't have many requirements from the govenment

# licensed softwares

no licensed softwares are used 

# software integrations

we have integrated metamask into our website to login user with their crypto wallet

# data sets and platforms

we have taken all our datasets from kaggle
